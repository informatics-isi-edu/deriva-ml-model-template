"""CIFAR-10 Stage 2: upload images, add classification features.

This module demonstrates the **asset-upload + feature-labeling
pattern**: how to upload binary files as ``Image`` assets inside
one Execution, then re-query the catalog and add feature values
inside a separate Execution for clean provenance.  The two-step
structure (2a upload, 2b label) is the key pattern to copy when
you need separate provenance records for data ingestion vs.
annotation.

This module is the assets layer. It downloads + extracts the
CIFAR-10 archive (via ``_cifar10_source``), uploads each image
as an ``Image`` asset inside one Execution, then adds an
``Image_Classification`` feature row for each image inside a
separate Execution.

Stage 2 is fully self-contained: it does not depend on
in-memory state from any earlier step. The feature-labeling
sub-stage recovers each image's class from its filename
(format: ``train_<class>_<id>.png`` or ``test_<class>_<id>.png``)
by reading the catalog, so it can be re-run against any
catalog where stage 1 is complete and some images exist.

Public API:
    - ``upload_images(ml, archive_path=None, max_images=None,
        batch_size=500)`` — Stage 2a.
    - ``add_classification_features(ml)`` — Stage 2b. Reads
      back uploaded Image rows from the catalog.
    - ``class_from_filename(filename)`` — pure helper that
      decodes the class from a CIFAR-10 image filename.
    - ``run_assets_phase(ml, max_images=None, batch_size=500)``
      — orchestrator that runs 2a then 2b.

    Groups ``items`` by their CIFAR-10 class (looked up in ``labels``

    determinism for a given ``seed``: each class's items are shuffled
