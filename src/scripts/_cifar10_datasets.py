"""CIFAR-10 Stage 3: create the dataset hierarchy.

This module demonstrates the **dataset-hierarchy pattern**: how
to query the catalog for existing assets, partition them via the
library's split/subsample primitives, and assemble a nested
dataset structure with derived holdout splits — all inside one
Execution. Copy this module when you need to turn a set of
uploaded assets into a structured dataset hierarchy with
train/test splits.

This module is the datasets layer. Given a catalog with the
schema set up and some Image asset rows uploaded (Stages 1 and
2 complete), it creates:

    - ``Complete`` (Labeled) — all images. Hand-built; it is the
      input to the canonical Split, not a Split itself.
    - ``Split`` (+ ``Training`` / ``Testing`` partition children) —
      the canonical Toronto train/test partition. Produced by
      ``split_dataset(selection_fn=cifar_canonical_partition)`` so
      the curators' fixed ``train_`` / ``test_`` filename prefix
      drives the partition. The two children carry the
      ``Split_Partition`` discriminator (deriva-ml v1.42, spec
      2026-06-01).
    - ``Small_Training`` (Labeled, ``Subsample``) — a stratified
      ``SMALL_TRAIN_SIZE`` sample of ``Training``. Produced by
      ``subsample()``; no parent Split — siblings are
      discoverable via the producing execution's outputs.
    - ``Small_Testing`` (Labeled, ``Subsample``) — same shape,
      drawn from ``Testing``.
    - ``Labeled_Split`` (and Training/Testing children) — 80/20
      split of training images via ``split_dataset()``.
    - ``Small_Labeled_Split`` (and Training/Testing children) —
      fixed 400/100 split when the training pool is >=500, else
      an 80/20 fallback for small-scale work.

The roles-don't-propagate rule: ``split_dataset`` assigns
``Training`` / ``Testing`` based on each partition's role in the
split, not by inheriting from the source. See CONTEXT.md
(``Datasets — types and partitions``) for the canonical framing.

Stage 3 reads back ``Image`` rows from the catalog and uses
each filename's ``train_`` or ``test_`` prefix to decide which
dataset each image belongs to. No in-memory state from Stage 2
is needed.

Public API:
    - ``create_dataset_hierarchy(ml, batch_size=500)`` — does
      all the work in one Execution.
    - ``run_datasets_phase(ml, batch_size=500)`` — orchestrator
      alias for symmetry with run_schema_phase / run_assets_phase.
